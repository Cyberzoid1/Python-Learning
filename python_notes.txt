Using %r prints out raw data for debugging {ex6}
when printing to concatenating variables its just print var + var2

print "." * 10 prints 10 .  like ..........

print """    This allows you to print multiple lines. like /* */
stuff
"""

Strings can be added together with , or + seemingly same output
  print "days: ", days
  print "days: " + days

When printing with input, end with , to not print a new line. Good for inputs
  print "enter x: ",
  x = raw_input()
  Of course this is better name = raw_input("What is your name? ")

Writing multiple lines to a string and writing it
  formatter = "%r\n%r\n%r\n"
  mystr = formatter % (line1, line2, line3)
  target.write(mystr)
  or
  mystr2 = line1 + " " + line2 + " " + line3 + "\n"
  target.write(mystr2)

ex 20 file funtions
file.seek(0)  goes to position 0
file.readline get line
print file.read() will print the entire file

ex 24 is a summary of previous exercises
