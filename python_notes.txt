Using %r prints out raw data for debugging {ex6}
when printing to concatenating variables its just print var + var2

print "." * 10 prints 10 .  like ..........

print """    This allows you to print multiple lines. like /* */
stuff
"""

Strings can be added together with , or + seemingly same output
print "days: ", days
print "days: " + days

When printing with input, end with , to not print a new line. Good for inputs
print "enter x: ",
x = raw_input()
Of course this is better name = raw_input("What is your name? ")
